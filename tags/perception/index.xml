      <description>The aim of our study is to investigate whether phonetic and phonological information are processed earlier in the brain compared to semantic information in speech perception. ERP components found at different times following the presentation of a speech or speech-like stimulus have been linked to the processing of different components of the speech signal (e.g. phonetic, semantic or syntactic information). Understanding the nature of ERP components involved in the processing of speech and, in particular, understanding their timing can be extremely useful in defining the structure of an architecture of speech perception and, in more general terms, of grammar.</description>

Introduction to the study.
Evidence from event-related potentials (ERP) indicates that phonological and semantic incongruities in online language processing and perception are solved at diff􏰀erent times in the brain (D’Arcy et al.</description>
